## Made With:
**Tech used:** Figma, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

Designed and built from scratch. Mobile-first development. My learning focused on design fundamentals, color theory, ux, device responsiveness, media queries/breakpoints, accessibility, darkmode, transitions, animation and so much more. Still under development.

## Aha-moments:
While the css property "margin: 0 auto" can be a godsend, flexbox can sometimes do even better. Combined with media queries, I love watching the page perfectly transition from a mobile-to-desktop layout and then back at the breakpoints. Another major success was the drop-down menu animation through css and javascript. 

## Optimizations and Future Plans
I learned how to facilitate better page layout and responsiveness on different devices when using flexbox paired with media queries and breakpoints.
